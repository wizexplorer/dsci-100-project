At this k, the `TRUE` observations overpower the `FALSE` observations at every point hence the model always chooses `TRUE` and gets a 100% recall. So, model isn't really learning the pattern. Hence, we use the other accuracy estimates to choose the best k as well.   \n",

After some tries, we find that the combination of 10% each for accuracy and recall and 80% for precision gives us the best k. (This was done through trial and error and hence not shown).   \n",

    "#### Relation to Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final k-NN model with the chosen k achieved recall = 1 for the subscriber (TRUE) class, accuracy of 0.75, and precision of about 0.74 on the test set.\n",
    "This means the model successfully identified all actual subscribers in the test data, which aligns with our original expectation that behavioural and\n",
    "demographic features (such as experience level, played hours, and session duration) carry useful signal for predicting subscription. We expected (from  Figure 1, 2 and 3) that more engaged and more experienced players would be easier to classify as subscribers, and the perfect recall for TRUE is consistent with this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the magnitude of the improvement over the trivial baseline (predicting every player as a subscriber) was modest: the baseline accuracy is roughly 0.73 (since 73% of the dataset represents the TRUE response), and our model improves this only slightly to 0.75 while still misclassifying most non-subscribers (correctly identifying only 1 out of 11).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This partially contradicts any expectation that we would achieve a model that clearly separates subscribers from non-subscribers; instead, our results show that, given a small and imbalanced dataset, k-NN struggles to learn a strong pattern for the minority non-subscriber class.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the model behaves in line with our priority of maximising recall for subscribers, but it confirms that distinguishing non-subscribers is considerably more difficult than we initially hoped."
